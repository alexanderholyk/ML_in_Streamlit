To clone and run this app locally:

- On command line, run: `git clone https://github.com/alexanderholyk/ML_in_Streamlit`

- Switch into the folder: `cd ML_in_Streamlit` or similar

- Optional: create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv` and then activate it with `source .venv/bin/activate`

- On command line, run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- On command line, run: `streamlit run app.py` This opens a browser window where the app will open.

- In text box, type a movie review to test. Follow the onscreen instructions to submit it. Then click the button `Analyze` to see the result!

### Assignment 1 - Streamlit App

## Homework Assignment: Building a Sentiment Analysis Web App with Streamlit

Objective: The goal of this assignment is to build a complete, end-to-end machine learning application. You will train a sentiment analysis model on movie review data, save it, and then build an interactive web app with Streamlit that allows a user to input any text and see the predicted sentiment. I have included sufficient hints and comments to assist you with completing this assignment easily. Feel free to email/Discord if you face any confusion.

**Due Date**: Thursday, 26th June. 11.59 pm MT

## Part 1: Data Preparation and Model Training

In this part, you will prepare the data, train a Naive Bayes classifier, and save the trained model pipeline.

#### Step 1: Get the Data

We will use the Large Movie Review Dataset (IMDB). For simplicity, you can use a pre-processed version available on Kaggle.

- Dataset: IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews

- Download the IMDB Dataset.csv file from the link above and place it in your project folder.

#### Step 2: Create a Training Script

Create a Python script named train_model.py. This script will be responsible for loading the data, training the model, and saving it.

#### Step 3: Load and Preprocess the Data

- Use pandas to load the IMDB Dataset.csv file.

- The dataset has two columns: review and sentiment. The sentiment is already conveniently labeled as positive or negative.

- You will need to split your data into features (the review text) and labels (the sentiment). Let's call them X and y.

#### Step 4: Train the Model

For this task, a combination of TfidfVectorizer and MultinomialNB (Naive Bayes) is a strong and classic baseline. To make the model easy to use in, package them together in a Pipeline.

- Import Pipeline from sklearn.pipeline, TfidfVectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text, and MultinomialNB from sklearn.naive_bayes.

- Create a pipeline that first transforms the text data using TfidfVectorizer and then feeds it to the MultinomialNB classifier.

- Train the pipeline on your entire dataset (X and y). No need to create a train-test split for this assignment

#### Step 5: Save the Model Pipeline

- Once the model is trained, you need to save it to a file so your Streamlit app can use it later.

- Use the joblib library to dump your trained Pipeline object into a file named sentiment_model.pkl.

Your train_model.py script should only be run once to generate the sentiment_model.pkl file.

## Part 2: Building the Streamlit Application

Now for the fun part! You will create a web interface for your model.

#### Step 1: Create the App Script

Create a new Python script named app.py.

#### Step 2: Set up the Basic App Layout

- Import streamlit and joblib.

- Give your application a title, for example: Movie Review Sentiment Analyzer.

- Write a short description of what the app does.

#### Step 3: Load the Saved Model

- Write a function to load sentiment_model.pkl using joblib.load().

- **Crucially, use the @st.cache_data decorator on this function (review Lab 1.5).** This ensures the model is loaded only once when the app starts, which is essential for performance.

#### Step 4: Create the User Input Interface

- Use st.text_area() to create a text box where the user can type or paste a movie review. Give it a descriptive label like "Enter a movie review to analyze:".

- Add a button with st.button() labeled "Analyze".

#### Step 5: Make Predictions and Display Results

- Write an if block that checks if the "Analyze" button has been pressed.

- Inside the if block:

    1. Get the text from the text area.

    2. Make sure the user has entered some text before trying to make a prediction.

    3. Use your loaded model pipeline's .predict() method on the user's text. Note that the pipeline expects a list or array of documents, so you'll need to pass the input text inside a list (e.g., [user_text]).

    4. The output will be the predicted sentiment ('positive' or 'negative').

    5. Display the result to the user in a clear way. Use st.subheader() or st.write() to show the prediction.

    6. Display the prediction probability using the model's .predict_proba() method.

    - Pro-tip: Make the output more engaging! If the sentiment is positive, you could write "Predicted Sentiment: Positive üëç" and if it's negative, "Predicted Sentiment: Negative üëé".

#### Step 6: Run Your App

Open your terminal in the project directory and run:

streamlit run app.py

Test your app with different reviews to see if it works as expected.

## Submission Guidelines
To receive full grade, you must push all the files on a GitHub repository (make sure it's public or add my email if you want to keep it private: rahimrasool17@gmail.com).

You only have to add the GitHub URL when submitting the assignment. You can work in pairs; however, make sure to submit your work individually in separate accounts and repositories.

Ensure to include the following files:

1. train_model.py (your model training script)

2. app.py (your Streamlit application script)

3. sentiment_model.pkl (the saved model file)

4. A requirements.txt file listing the libraries needed to run your project (e.g., streamlit, pandas, scikit-learn, joblib).

5. A README file with a simple paragraph on how to clone and run your app locally. Preferably, write it in bullet points.


## Bonus Points (Optional)
For extra credit, you can add one or more of the following features:

Display the prediction probability using the model's .predict_proba() method.
Style the output with color. For example, show positive predictions in green and negative predictions in red. (Hint: st.success() and st.error())
